				<div class="bodypara-head">Title: Multiagent Systems for Privacy-Aware Social Computing</div>
				<div class="bodypara-text">
				<p>
				<b>Research Theme:</b> 
				A socially intelligent personal agent understands and helps its user respect the norms governing
				the userâ€™s interaction in a society. This research addresses the research question of how can we
				engineer social intelligence in personal agents to deliver a privacy-preserving social experience.
				Addressing this research question, we develop multiagent system techniques to engineer such
				personal agents.
				</p>

				<p>
				<b>Methods:</b> 
				This research develops (1) Arnor, an agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) method to
				model social intelligence in privacy-aware personal agents, and (2) Poros, a framework that
				enables personal agents to reason about shared contexts, and learn contextually relevant social
				norms that preserve privacy
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Arnor goes beyond traditional AOSE methods to engineer personal agents by systematically
				capturing interactions that influence social experience.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				A personal agent may deviate from norms under certain contexts. Poros (1) enables personal
				agents deviating from norms to share deviation contexts with other agents in the agent society,
				and (2) provides personal agents the ability to reason about shared contexts.

				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Claims:</b> 
				We claim that (1) Arnor supports developers in engineering personal agents, and (2) personal
				agents engineered using Arnor provide a better privacy-preserving social experience than agents
				engineered using a traditional AOSE method. We evaluate Arnor via a developer study, and
				a set of simulation experiments, and measure the social experience of social metrics of norm
				compliance and sanction proportion.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We make two claims about the impact of context sharing and reasoning in Poros. First,
				an ability to reason about deviation contexts helps personal agents accurately learn applicable
				context-dependent norms. Second, by acting according to such shared context-dependent norms
				that preserve privacy, a personal agent can provide its users a more satisfying social experience
				than an agent that does not reason about shared context. We demonstrate these claims via
				social simulations involving agent societies of varying sizes and diverse characteristics reflecting
				pragmatic, considerate, and selfish agents.

				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Proposed Work:</b>
				Complying to social norms require agents to perform or not perform certain actions. An understanding
				of values such as privacy or security, each of these actions promote or demote could
				help personal agents to decide whether or not to pursue those actions. We propose Valar, a
				framework to reason about values, and Gimli, a decision support system based on Valar to
				assist SIPAs make a decision in scenarios where norms conflict.
