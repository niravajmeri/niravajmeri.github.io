				<div class="bodypara-head">Title: Engineering Multiagent Systems for Ethics and Privacy-Aware Social Computing</div>
				<div class="bodypara-text">
				<p> A socially intelligent personal agent understands and helps its user navigate the norms governing the user's interaction in a society. This research seeks to advance the science of privacy by tackling nuanced notions of privacy in personal agents. It addresses the research question of how we can engineer social intelligence in a personal agent such that it selects ethically appropriate actions and delivers a pleasant and privacy-preserving social experience. We develop multiagent system techniques to engineer such socially intelligent and ethical personal agents.
				</p>
				
				<p> This research develops (1) Arnor, a software engineering method to engineer privacy-aware personal agents by modeling social intelligence via norms, (2) Poros, an approach that enables personal agents to reason about shared contexts and infer contextually relevant social norms that preserve privacy, and (3) Ainur, a decision-making framework to design personal agents that can reason about values and act ethically. 
				</p>

				<p> Arnor goes beyond traditional software engineering methods to engineer personal agents by systematically capturing interactions that influence social experience. We claim that (1) Arnor supports developers in engineering intelligent personal agents, and (2) personal agents engineered using Arnor provide a better privacy-preserving social experience than agents engineered using a traditional software engineering method. We evaluate Arnor via a developer study and a set of simulation experiments and measure the social experience via metrics of norm compliance and sanction proportion.
				</p>

				<p> A personal agent may deviate from norms in certain contexts. Poros (1) enables personal agents deviating from norms to share the context of a deviation with other agents and (2) provides personal agents the ability to reason about shared contexts. We make two claims about the impact of context sharing and reasoning in Poros. First, the ability to reason about deviation contexts helps a personal agent  accurately infer contextually relevant norms and act in a privacy-respecting manner. Second, by acting according to such contextually relevant norms, a personal agent yields higher goal satisfaction to its users than an agent that does not reason about shared contexts. We demonstrate these claims via social simulations involving agent societies of varying sizes and diverse characteristics reflecting pragmatic, considerate, and selfish agents.
				</p>
				
				<p> Privacy, values, and ethics are closely intertwined. Preserving privacy presumes understanding human values and acting ethically. Ainur equips a personal agent with an understanding of values such as pleasure, privacy, recognition, and security, promoted or demoted by the agent's actions. This understanding of values helps personal agents select ethically appropriate actions, especially in scenarios where either the norms conflict or the value preferences of the users are not aligned.  We empirically evaluate Ainur via simulation experiments. We find that agents developed using Ainur produce ethical actions that exhibit fairness and yield a pleasant social experience to the agents' users.
